# Django Test Project

This project is created to practice Django as my first time trying out this framework before working on developing an application for my internship. I'm pretty experienced in C++ however, I've had minimal experience with Python and I want to develop my Python skills.


# Progression

Heres my progress in learning Django:

- Understand the installation process (Python, virtual environments, and Django)
- Understand Django project: `django-admin startproject <project-name>`
- Understand Django apps: `django-admin startapp <app-name>`
- Understand what is a URLconf (URL Configuration)
- Understand HTML templates and dynamic HTML
